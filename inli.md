<span class="eng">Essentially, all you need to do is fork this repository and update the _config.yml file with the correct information about your repository.

This repository is a fork of Jekyll GH Actions Quickstart. After that all I did was add the linja pona font file to the top level and a _sass/custom/custom.scss file.

For more information, see these links:
